### Data Journey

**Data Source:** My journey began with the rich data source provided by [Citi Bike Data](Links to an external site.). Here's what I did:

1.  **Data Selection:** I carefully curated data files from the Citi Bike Trip History Logs, ensuring that I adhered to Tableau's data file size limit of 1GB and focused on datasets from the past year (June 2022 - June 2023).
    
2.  **Data Aggregation:** I aggregated the selected data, transforming it into a consolidated dataset ready for analysis.
    

### Discovering Insights

The heart of the project was uncovering two unexpected phenomena hidden within the Citi Bike data:

#### Phenomenon 1: _Urban Pulse_

_What I Found:_ Describe the first phenomenon here.

-   **Data Dive:** I delved deep into the dataset, hunting for patterns, anomalies, and trends.
-   **Visual Story:** I crafted 2-5 dynamic visualizations that brought the phenomenon to life.
-   **Answering the Why:** I addressed critical questions such as total recorded trips, percentage growth in ridership, shifts in user type proportions, and pinpointed peak hours for bike usage, whether under the scorching sun of summer or the chill of winter.

#### Phenomenon 2: _Biking Secrets_

_What I Found:_ Describe the second phenomenon here.

-   **Data Exploration:** I took a similar journey into the data to unveil this hidden treasure.
-   **Visual Revelations:** I designed another set of 2-5 visualizations that showcased the essence of this phenomenon.
-   **Uncovering Insights:** I provided valuable insights, including how average trip duration varied by user type, the average distance traveled in a bike trip, bikes in need of maintenance, and the intriguing variability in bike utilization.

### Crafting Engaging Dashboards

Harnessing the power of Tableau, I created captivating dashboards for each of the two phenomena. These weren't just data dashboards; they were narratives that used visualizations, charts, and graphs to convey compelling stories.

### Final Presentation

To make sure my findings were crystal clear, I weaved them together into a Tableau story. This presentation merged all the visualizations, including the requested maps (basic or advanced), to create a comprehensive, engaging, and informative narrative.


## Conclusion

This project has been an incredible journey, and I'm proud to have completed it as the New York Citi Bike Lead Analyst. My work is poised to drive meaningful improvements in our city's bike-sharing program, and I'm excited to see the impact it will have. Here's to more exciting projects and discoveries in the future!
